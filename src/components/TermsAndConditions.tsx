          <strong>1. Making a booking</strong>
          <br />
          A booking allows you to reserve a vehicle and optional extras for ‘pick-up’ at a particular time, date 
          and location and for the agreed rental period. You must meet our Rental Requirements. You must 
          agree and signed the Rental Agreement, unless you are an Avis Preferred member and have opted 
          in to the master rental agreement. 
          Avis Preferred members who have opted in to the master rental agreement will have agreed to the 
          rental terms and conditions at the time when you signed up to MFF Preferred. Nevertheless, even 
          Avis Preferred members will be required to sign the Rental Agreement where legal requirements 
          require that a local rental agreement is concluded, where you have not opted in to the master rental 
          agreement or where your rental is at the location that does not offer the MFF Preferred service.
          
          The rental agreement is governed by the law of the country where you pick-up the 
          vehicle and is formed between you and the vehicle rental provider at the time off 
          pick-up, if you meet all the rental requirements. The vehicle rental provider will be a 
          member of the Avis Rent-a-Car system. This booking is not a rental agreement. 
          By making a booking you agree to be provided with a copy of these bookings terms, the General 
          Conditions and the Location Conditions electronically using the email address you have provided.

          fee if we can cancel your booking because you failed to meet the Rental Requirements. You 
          must pay a fee if you don’t cancel your booking and you fail to show-up. We Call this a

          <strong>Vehicles</strong>
          <br />
          If there are no vehicles available in the group you booked, the rental location will try to find you a 
          vehicle from a higher group at no extra cost. If they can only find a vehicle in a lower group and you 
          agree to rent this vehicle, you will only be charged for the value of that vehicle. If you have already 
          paid, you will be entitled to a refund of the difference.
          This rarely happens, but if no vehicles are available, you will of course be entitled to a full refund of 
          any amount you have already paid.
